Welcome to my blog. Occasionally an idea builds up in my head for too long and I can't get it out of my head until I write it down. I started this as a way to be able to reference the ideas.

The posts on this blog are mostly related to software. I'm just some guy in the mid-west that seems to be reasonably adequate at software. Don't do something stupid, like yolo cuda into your production system when you don't need it just because you saw it on this blog.
